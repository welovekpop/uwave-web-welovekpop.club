# 1.0.0-beta.2 / 22 Nov 2016

Features:

  * Add a configurable About page overlay. Use

    contents of the overlay.
  * Add a video toolbar that shows when hovering the video area. The toolbar
    contains buttons to toggle Small Video mode and a new Fullscreen mode. Media
    sources can export a source-specific `VideoTools` component that will be
    rendered into the toolbar when media from that source is playing.
  * Publish ES-modules formatted code in es/ folder. Publish translations as JS
    files so a yaml plugin is not required for custom builds.

    size of the chat history.

  * The user list and wait list now properly fill the entire side panel.

    is a lot more robust.
  * Upgrade dependencies.
  * Inline ReconnectingWebSocket dependency.
  * Remove postcss-bem plugin, instead only using cssnext for CSS features.
    The postcss-bem project is abandoned.
